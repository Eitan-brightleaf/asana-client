# GitHub Actions workflow for Continuous Integration (CI)
# This pipeline validates Composer config, installs dependencies, audits for vulnerabilities,
# enforces PSR-12 coding standards via PHPCS (lint job), runs PHPUnit tests with coverage (tests job),
# and verifies compatibility with the lowest allowed dependency versions (lowest-deps job).
# Tests run on multiple PHP versions to ensure broad compatibility.
